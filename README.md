# Pokedex
A simple pokedex App -> A design of this app will be based on https//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.timemac.dev.simplepokedex2 -> According to that, it will contain a view that will show pokemons in ascendant order from 1 in the main view -> It will also allow to filter pokemons by using a searchbar in the top of the screen, as well as an implementation of a bottom navigation view that will allow an user to search pokemons by type -> By tapping on a pokemon's picture, the user will be able to check additional information about that pokemon -> The information of the app will be taken from https://pokeapi.co/ -> Animations, and other aspects of frontend design will be added as the project goes further, but nothing has been explicitly required.
